You are given a list of city-data. Cities that may contain a power plant have been labeled 1. Others not suitable for building a plant are labeled 0. Given a distribution range of k, find the lowest number of plants that must be built such that all cities are served. The distribution range limits supply to cities where the distance is less than k.
